# NLP Project on USPatentClassification using HuggingFace Transformers and Kaggle Dataset

## Introduction
This project is an NLP project that aims to classify US patent documents based on their text descriptions. The project uses the HuggingFace Transformers library and a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify US patent documents based on their text descriptions.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the requirements specified in the requirements.txt file. You can install them by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to have a Kaggle account to access the dataset used in this project. To access the dataset, you need to download the kaggle.json file from your Kaggle account and save it in the same location as your Jupyter notebook or Python script.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the USPatentClassification dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The dataset contains text descriptions of US patent documents and their corresponding patent classes. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned, so it is ready for use in machine learning models.

## Methodology
The project uses the HuggingFace Transformers library to build a machine learning model for text classification. The model is trained on the USPatentClassification dataset using a transformer-based neural network architecture. The model is then evaluated on a test dataset to measure its accuracy in classifying US patent documents.

## Running the Notebook
To run the notebook, you need to have a GPU, as the training of the model can be computationally intensive. Ideally, you can run the notebook on Google Colab, which provides free access to GPUs.

To run the notebook, open it in your Jupyter notebook or in Google Colab and execute the code cells one by one. Make sure that you have saved the kaggle.json file in the same location as the notebook.

## Conclusion
This NLP project shows how machine learning models can be used to classify US patent documents based on their text descriptions. The HuggingFace Transformers library and the USPatentClassification dataset from Kaggle provide powerful tools for building accurate and efficient text classification models. By following the steps outlined in this project, you can build your own machine learning model for classifying US patent documents or for other text classification tasks.
